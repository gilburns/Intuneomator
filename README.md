**Swift-based automated application management for Microsoft Intune**

Intuneomator is a powerful macOS enterprise application that bridges the gap between the open-source [Installomator](https://github.com/Installomator/Installomator) project and Microsoft Intune, providing IT administrators with comprehensive automation capabilities for macOS application lifecycle management.

#### As mentioned in [MC1066336](https://mc.merill.net/message/MC1066336), starting July 31, 2025, or soon after, the following Graph APIs will require either DeviceManagementScripts.Read.All or DeviceManagementScripts.ReadWrite.All permissions to continue working:  
~/deviceManagement/deviceShellScripts  
~/deviceManagement/deviceCustomAttributeShellScripts  
~/deviceManagement/deviceManagementScripts

Since **Intuneomator** utilizes there API, you should add **DeviceManagementScripts.ReadWrite** permissions to your app registration to continue using the built in Shell Script and Custom Attribute managers.
